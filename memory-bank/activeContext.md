# Active Context

## Project Summary
The Drawing Board App is a web-based drawing application built with Angular 19 and Ionic components. It provides a digital canvas for creating sketches using both mouse and touch inputs, with tools for color selection, line width adjustment, and image export.

## Current State
The application consists of three main components:
1. **DrawingCanvasComponent**: Implements the drawing canvas with event handlers for mouse and touch interactions
2. **DrawingToolbarComponent**: Provides UI controls for customizing drawing parameters
3. **DrawingService**: Manages state and communication between components

The current implementation supports:
- Drawing on canvas with mouse and touch input
- Selecting from a predefined color palette
- Adjusting line width with a slider control
- Saving drawings as PNG or JPEG files

## Technical Architecture Overview
- **Angular 19.2.0** framework with standalone components
- **Ionic 8.5.6** for UI components and mobile-friendly interface
- **HTML5 Canvas API** for drawing functionality
- **RxJS** for state management between components
- **Angular Signals** for reactive internal component state

## Key Implementation Details

### Canvas Drawing
The DrawingCanvasComponent initializes an HTML canvas element and provides these core features:
- Dynamic canvas sizing based on container dimensions
- Event handlers for both mouse and touch interactions
- Coordinate conversion for accurate drawing
- Line styling based on service-provided parameters

```typescript
private drawLine(x1: number, y1: number, x2: number, y2: number): void {
  this.context.beginPath();
  this.context.moveTo(x1, y1);
  this.context.lineTo(x2, y2);
  this.context.stroke();
}
```

### Color Management
The color selection system includes:
- Predefined color palette in the toolbar component
- Selection indicator to show the active color
- Service-based state management for color synchronization
- Observable stream for color changes

```typescript
// Color selection in DrawingToolbarComponent
selectColor(color: string): void {
  this.selectedColor.set(color);
  this.drawingService.setColor(color);
}

// Color subscription in DrawingCanvasComponent
this.drawingService.currentColor$.subscribe((color) => {
  this.context.strokeStyle = color;
});
```

### Line Width Control
The line width adjustment system includes:
- Slider control for selecting line width (1-20px)
- Visual feedback in the drawing
- Service-based state management

### Export Functionality
The export system implements:
- Format selection dialog (PNG or JPEG)
- Background handling for transparent canvas
- Automatic download triggering
- Success/failure feedback

## Current Limitations
- No undo/redo functionality
- Limited to predefined colors
- No ability to save drawings within the application
- Single drawing layer

## Future Development Opportunities
1. Implement undo/redo functionality
2. Add custom color selection
3. Introduce different brush styles
4. Add text and shape tools
5. Implement a gallery system for saved drawings

## Active Development Focus
The current focus is on ensuring the core drawing functionality works correctly across devices, with special attention to the responsiveness of the drawing canvas and the correctness of the export functionality.
