## Overview
The Drawing Board App is an Angular-based web application that allows users to draw on a digital canvas. The app provides a simple yet effective interface for creating drawings with touch and mouse support, offering features like color selection, line width adjustment, and image exporting.

## Core Features
- Interactive canvas with drawing capabilities
- Support for both mouse and touch input devices
- Color selection from a predefined palette
- Adjustable line width for drawing
- Ability to save drawings as PNG or JPEG images

## Technical Architecture
- **Framework**: Angular 19.2.0
- **UI Components**: Ionic 8.5.6
- **State Management**: RxJS Observables and Angular Signals
- **Canvas Manipulation**: HTML5 Canvas API

## Main Components
1. **DrawingCanvasComponent**: Handles canvas rendering and user interactions
2. **DrawingToolbarComponent**: Provides tools for customizing drawing parameters and saving output
3. **DrawingService**: Manages the shared state between components and handles drawing operations

## User Interaction Flow
